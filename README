detailed description
--------------------
Meet a couple of pure-Qt/C++ classes capable of handling PKZIP 2.0 compatible
zip archives.

This is not a "port" of some other existing implementation, everything has been
written from scratch (althought some code was actually inspired by existing
public domain projects) and it's all pure C++/Qt. Please note that this is not
a complete stand-alone library, it's just a bunch of classes. You will have to
add them to your project and modify them to best fit your needs.

It supports basic features like file extraction and compression (with optional
password encryption) and archive comments. There are methods to extract single
files or the whole archive and methods to compress the contents of a whole
directory. Nevertheless, it should be quite trivial to add other features.
The public API only has a few methods because this is what I was looking for.
This does not mean you can't write a few more lines of code (it really shouldn't
take more than a few lines!) to add more features.

The classes are great if you only need to use the PKZIP format for loading/saving
your application's data. Just remember that you will need to customize a few
parts of the code, i.e. to add your own password retrieval method.

zlib is used for actual compression and decompression.

Please refer to the example application's main.cpp file or to the class comments
in the source files for details and more usage examples.

features
--------
- Pure C++/Qt based, clean & oo implementation.
- Retrieve archive contents information before extracting any file.
- Fast (but less robust with corrupt archives) parsing of the ZIP file format.
- Traditional PKWARE password encryption (strong encryption as introduced by PKZip
  versions 5.0 and later is NOT available).
- Support for archive comments.
- Optional namespace and shared lib support (see below)
- Time zone support (see below)

missing features and restrictions
---------------------------------
- Needs to be modified to fit into an existing project (i.e.: you might need to
  add your own password handling routine).
- Weak support of corrupted archives (althought some files could be extracted
  even if the archive is corrupted).
- No support for filesystem specific features like unix symbolic links.
- No support for spanned archives.
- No support for strong encryption or features introduced after PKZIP
  version 2.0 (see the PKWARE specs for details).

requirements
------------
Qt version 4.0.x or later
zlib library

namespace support
-----------------
If you need the classes to be inside a namespace, simply define OSDAB_NAMESPACE
in the project file. The classes will then be in a Osdab::Zip namespace.

building as a shared library (.DLL / .so / .dylib)
--------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to achieve this. The easiest and cleanest way is to
edit the zipglobal.h file and remove the "#ifndef OSDAB_ZIP_LIB" block.
The other way consists in #defining OSDAB_ZIP_LIB in both the project
you create for the shared zip library and in the projects linking the library.
An example in the "Example.SharedLib" directory contains such a sample build.

time zones
----------
Time zone support is implemented only on Windows and Unix compatible systems.
It can be disabled by defining OSDAB_ZIP_NO_UTC in the project file.
The currentUtcOffset() method in zipglobal.cpp is where the current UTC offset
is calculated. Qt has no proper time zone support (Qt 4.7.x) so the code
relies on gmtime and localtime.
